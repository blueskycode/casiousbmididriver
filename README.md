# Casio USB MIDI Driver for Mac OS X


This is the new home of the MIDI Driver for older, USB-only Casio keyboards that do not work out of the box on Mac OS X. The driver is entirely based on sample code from Apple's SDK, and should work with many models of Casio keyboards. The project originated on Google Code, and you can still visit its old home at:

http://code.google.com/p/casiousbmididriver

## Installation

The latest release supports Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and up:

https://github.com/francoisferland/casiousbmididriver/releases/download/release-1.0/Casio.USB.MIDI.Driver.10.7.pkg


To install the driver, simply double-click on the installation package. It will install for all users on your machine.

You should then be able to plug your keyboard with a USB cable and power it up, it will show up in the Audio & MIDI Setup utility as "Casio USB Keyboard".
